    "Description": "This model is a Chemprop neural network trained with a growth inhibition dataset. Authors screened ~7,500 molecules for those that inhibited the growth of A. baumannii in vitro. They discovered abaucin, an antibacterial compound with narrow-spectrum activity against A. baumannii.",

    "Interpretation": "Probability of growth inhibition of the bacteria A. Baumannii. For a Threshold > 80% (0.8) they are considered active for inhibiting the growth of the A. baumannii. Note that a threshold of 0.2 was also considered in the training phase, allowing for the exploration of a broader set of compounds and which may need evaluation in later stages even if it does not reach 0.8, which is the threshold to reach. maximum effectiveness against A. Baumannii",
